# <ins> Sticky roles </ins>

## **An app that will give a user back their roles on rejoin, based on the settings you set.**

### It can:

1. Save a users roles for re-assignment on re join to a server <br />
<br />
<img src="./readme/gallery/user_roles.png" style="max-width: 60%"> <br />
<br />
2. Detect if a user has joined in the past, and send a different welcome message: <br />
<br />
<img src="./readme/gallery/welcome_message.PNG" style="max-width: 60%"> <br />
<br />
3. Exclude certain roles from re assignment, which can be managed by either slash or prefix commands (Administrator only)<br />
<br />

### <ins> Setup </ins>

<ins> **Enviroment variables:**  </ins>

â€¢ **welcome-channel**: Set a channel where your bot welcome's members back. Just copy the ID of it by right-clicking on the channel name

â€¢ **PREFIX**: The prefix you want your bot to use (eg !)
<br />
**This is not mandatory for it to work as you can use slash commands instead**

<ins> **Saving Roles:** </ins>

The roles of your users aren't saved yet! To save them you must use the *refresh_roles.js* file.

Just click on the link to run the file, as shown below. Make sure your bot is in a server as well!<br />

<img src="/readme/gallery/link.PNG" style="max-width: 60%"> <br />
<br />

You can now close that tab and go back to your code window. Go to bottom left and click 'View logs'. 
It should look something like this:
<br />
<img src="./readme/gallery/log.PNG" style="max-width: 60%"> <br />
<br />
If there are errors, a link for the Autocode Support Server is at the bottom for help

#### Note:

â€¢ **If your bot is added to a new guild, you will need to run the code again**

â€¢ **If your bot is in lots of guilds and/or with lots of members, you may reach your execution timeout limit.**
**Make sure it is set to 30000ms (bottom left -> Advanced settings) to allow for a greater amount of time**

â€¢ **After that, the bot should be logging all other role changes automatically in** *update.js*


 <ins>**Excluded roles:** </ins>

#### What are they?

These are roles which are excluded from sticky roles and **will not be added to members when they rejoin**, even if they had that role.

<ins>*Commands* </ins>

â€¢ `excluded-roles-add` - This adds the specified role onto the list. You can @ the role or the ID to specify the role
  
â€¢ `excluded-roles-remove`- This removes a specified role off the list. You can @ the role or the ID to specify the role
  
â€¢ `excluded-roles-list` - This lists all the excluded roles in that server

â€¢ `excluded-roles-clear` - This clears all the excluded roles for that server
<br />

<ins> **Slash command setup** </ins> <br />
<br />
<img src="./readme/gallery/slash_commands.PNG" style="max-width: 60%">
<br />
<br />

1. Go to Autocode's handy Slash Command Builder: https://autocode.com/tools/discord/command-builder/

2. Link your bot using **link account** option at the top

3. Make all 4 slash commands: `excluded-roles-add`, `excluded-roles-remove`, `excluded-roles-clear` and `excluded-roles-list`

4. For *excluded-roles-add* and *excluded-roles-remove* set a *required* option on each. Set type to *Role*. You can set name and description to whatever you want


### Then, you can add roles as simply as this!

<img src="./readme/gallery/add.gif" style="max-width: 60%"> <br />
<br />

### And if you use the command incorrectly it will tell you: <br />
<br />
<img src="./readme/gallery/format_error.PNG" style="max-width: 60%">
<br />
<br />

### Also, it checks the ID. Giving an invalid ID will return this: 
<br />
<img src="./readme/gallery/role_ID_error.PNG" style="max-width: 60%">
<br />
<br />


### Required bot permissions

*Your bot needs to be invited to the server with minimum permissions of:*
`Manage Roles`
`View Channels`
`Send Messages`
(If you are using slash commands) `Use Slash Commands`

Your bot also needs **Server Members Intent** enabled

You can do this by going to: 
https://discord.com/developers/applications -> [Your bot] -> Bot -> Privileged Gateway Intents -> **Enable Server Members Intent**

Also, make sure your bot's highest role is at the top. This is normally the main cause of permission errors when adding roles
<br />
The app should warn you if it failed to give any roles to a certain user

### How is the data stored?

All data is stored using *utils.kv* and is exclusive for each guild, so you can use this app for multiple guilds ðŸ’¯

*A users roles are logged with the format:*

**key:** `[guild ID][user ID]_roles`
<br />
**value:** `[users roles in an array as <@&ROLE_ID>]`

*Excluded roles are logged with the format:*

**key:** `[guild ID]_excludedroles`
<br />
**value:** `[roles in array as <@&ROLE_ID>]`

*Users who have left the server are logged with the format:*

**key:** `[guild ID]_leave`
<br />
**value:** `users ID's in array`


Hope this is a useful guide to setting up this app!
